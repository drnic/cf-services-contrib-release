## Cloud Foundry Services Contrib Release

This repository contains legacy services components which are not under active development. We can cannot vouch for their functionality. Feel free to try them as-is and enhance them as needed.

$ echo "---\ndev_name: cf-services-contrib" > config/dev.yml
$ bosh create release --force
$ bosh -n upload release
```

## Repository Contents

This repository is structures for use with BOSH, an open source tool for release engineering, deployment and lifecycle management of large scale distributed services. The directories are:

- **.final_builds**
- **config**: pointers to dependencies cached in the BOSH blobstore.
- **git**
- **jobs**: start and stop commands for each of the jobs (processes) running on Cloud Foundry nodes.
- **packages**: packaging instructions used by BOSH to build each of the dependencies.
- **releases**: yml files containing the git commit shas for each package in a given release.
- **src**: the source code for the components in Cloud Foundry. Note that each of the components is a submodule with a pointer to a specific sha. So even if you do not use BOSH to deploy Cloud Foundry, the list of submodule pointers

See the [documentation for deploying Cloud Foundry](http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/docs/running/deploying-cf/) for more information about using BOSH.

In order to deploy Cloud Foundry with BOSH, you will need to create a manifest. You can find a [sample manifest in the documentation](http://cloudfoundry.github.com/docs/running/deploying-cf/vsphere/cloud-foundry-example-manifest.html).

## Source Code

The source code for these services can be found inside this repo in the src/services folder
